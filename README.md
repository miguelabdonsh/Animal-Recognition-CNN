## Animal-Recognition-CNN

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying animal images.

### Model 1

The first model is an initial CNN approach that classifies images into 10 different animal classes using the provided dataset.

### Model 2

The second model proposes design changes based on the results and analysis of the first model. The objective is to improve the performance of the classification to seek a better development of the model.
